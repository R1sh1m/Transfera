## What is Transfera?

Transfera is a local desktop application for **cryptographically verified media backup**. It transfers photos, videos, and audio from any source — local folders, iPhone, iPad, or USB-attached cameras — to an organised archive destination, verifying every byte in transit before committing the file.

Unlike a plain copy, Transfera's **Two-Stage Verified Pipeline** ensures no silent corruption ever reaches your archive:

```
Source Files ──▶ [Hop 1: Cache] ──▶ [Hop 2: Archive] ──▶ Verified Backup
                  BLAKE3 hash            re-verify
                  .partial write         atomic rename
```

| Hop | From | To | Guarantee |
|-----|------|----|-----------|
| **Hop 1** | Original source files | Local staging cache | Stream-copied with concurrent BLAKE3 hash; only renamed from `.partial` on hash match |
| **Hop 2** | Verified cache copy | Final archive directory | Hash re-verified before atomic placement into organised `YYYY/MM/DD` folder structure |

---

## Key Features

- **BLAKE3 hashing** (SHA-256 fallback) computed *during* the copy stream — no second read required
- **Atomic writes** via `.partial` staging — a corrupt or interrupted file never lands in your archive
- **iPhone & iPad support** via native WPD driver integration and optional WSL2 bridge (Tier 2)
- **Live Photo detection** — pairs HEIC + MOV files by matching filename, preserving them together
- **Duplicate detection** — exact (hash-based) and near-duplicate (metadata similarity) resolution with per-file controls
- **Crash recovery** — interrupted `LOADING` and `ARCHIVED` batch states are automatically resumed on next launch
- **Real-time transfer monitor** — WebSocket-driven progress with per-hop bars, ETA, speed, and media thumbnail preview
- **Media library** — masonry/list/history views of every archived file, with infinite scroll and thumbnail regeneration
- **SQLite WAL mode** — safe concurrent reads during active writes; no database lock contention
- **ExifTool auto-bootstrap** — downloads and manages ExifTool automatically; no manual installation needed

---

## Prerequisites

Only **two tools** need to be on your system before running Transfera. Everything else — Python virtual environment, pip packages, npm packages, native build tools, ExifTool — is handled automatically on first launch.

On Windows, you can install both prerequisites in a single command using `winget`:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12 ; winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

---

### 1. Python 3.12

Transfera requires Python **3.12.x** specifically. This version is enforced because several core dependencies (`blake3`, `pillow-heif`) only ship pre-compiled wheels for 3.12, avoiding any need for local compilation.

You can install it with the following `winget` command:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12
```

*(Or download the installer from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check **"Add python.exe to PATH"** during setup).*

Verify after installation:

```powershell
python --version
# Python 3.12.x
```

> If you have multiple Python versions installed, the `py` launcher (`py -3.12`) is also supported — the run script probes for it automatically.

### 2. Node.js v20 or later

The Electron shell and Vite build pipeline require Node **v20 LTS** or newer.

You can install it with the following `winget` command:

```powershell
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

*(Or download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) — choose the LTS release).*

Verify after installation:

```powershell
node --version
# v20.x.x or higher
```

### That's it

Everything else — the `.venv`, pip packages, `node_modules`, the React build, ExifTool, and the native WPD device helper — is set up automatically the first time you run `python run.py`.

---

## Quickstart

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/R1sh1m/Transfera.git
cd Transfera
python run.py
```

The orchestrator runs through a self-bootstrapping sequence on first launch (takes 2–4 minutes on a clean machine):

```
[PYTHON]   Locating Python 3.12 interpreter
[STEP 1]   Creating .venv and installing backend dependencies
[STEP 2]   Installing frontend npm packages
[STEP 2.5] Compiling React frontend (Vite)
[STEP 2.6] Building native WPD device helper (requires MSVC — see below)
[STEP 3]   Launching FastAPI backend on :47821
[STEP 3]   Launching Electron + Vite dev shell
```

Subsequent launches skip all setup steps automatically (only runs again when `requirements.txt` or `package.json` change).

Press **Ctrl+C** at any time for a clean teardown of all processes.

---

## iPhone & iPad Support — Native Helper

Transfera's iOS device support is powered by a native C++ helper compiled against the Windows Portable Devices (WPD) API. The run script builds it automatically, but **requires Microsoft's C++ compiler (MSVC)** to be present on the system.

Install one of:

- **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** (smaller, C++ compiler only) via the following one-line `winget` command:
  ```powershell
  winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended --passive"
  ```
- **Visual Studio 2022** (any edition, free Community edition works) with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.

The build script locates the compiler via `vswhere.exe` automatically — no PATH configuration needed.

> **If you skip this step**, Transfera still runs fully. Local folder and network path backups work without the native helper. iPhone/iPad detection simply won't be available until MSVC is installed and the helper is built.

To build it manually at any time:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build:native
```

---

## Runner Reference

```powershell
python run.py               # Start everything (recommended)
python run.py --backend     # Backend API only (no Electron window)
python run.py --frontend    # Electron + Vite dev shell only
python run.py --skip-deps   # Skip all setup checks (fast relaunch)
```

The full dev stack runs two processes:

| Process | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| FastAPI backend | `http://127.0.0.1:47821` | REST API + WebSocket + static frontend server |
| Electron (Vite HMR) | `http://127.0.0.1:5173` | Dev shell with hot-module reload |

---

## Building a Standalone Installer

To produce a distributable Windows installer (`.exe`) that bundles the Python backend, the React frontend, and Electron into a self-contained package:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run electron:build
```

Output is written to:

```
frontend/release/Transfera-Setup-2.4.0.exe    ← NSIS installer
frontend/release/win-unpacked/                ← Portable build
```

Build pipeline: TypeScript compile → Vite bundle → Electron Builder NSIS packaging.

**Prerequisites for building:** the `.venv` must already exist (run `python run.py` once first), and MSVC must be installed for the native WPD helper.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| `Python 3.12 not found` | Ensure Python 3.12 is installed and `python --version` returns `3.12.x`. The `py -3.12` launcher is also probed automatically. |
| `Port 47821 already in use` | A previous run may not have shut down cleanly. The orchestrator auto-sweeps stray processes on startup; if it still fails, kill the process occupying the port manually. |
| `npm install` permission error | Run your terminal as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator). |
| iPhone not detected | Ensure MSVC is installed and `npm run build:native` has completed (look for `wpd_helper.exe` in `backend/bin/`). Trust the computer on your iPhone when prompted. |
| Blank page after navigating | Known bug — fixed in the current branch. See [issue tracker](https://github.com/R1sh1m/Transfera/issues). |
| Thumbnails showing wrong images | Known bug — fixed in the current branch. Caused by a stale negative-cache between sessions. |
| ExifTool not found | First-run auto-bootstrap handles this. If it fails, check internet connectivity; ExifTool is downloaded from `exiftool.org` on first launch. |
| `wpd_helper build failed: LNK1104` | The `.exe` is locked by a running Transfera backend. Fully close the app (`Ctrl+C` in the terminal) and retry. |

---

## Running Tests

```powershell
cd backend
